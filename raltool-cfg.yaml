# Settings for the combine pass.
combines:
  # By default, the combiner will claim that field's enums are equivalent if their
  # plurality, bit size, and values are the same. It does not consider the enum name.
  # Once they're deemed equivalent, the combiner is allowed to consolidate these enums
  # across all fields and devices. This default behavior lets us consolidate enum variants
  # that are written like "OFF / ON" in one SVD, and "DISABLED / ENABLED" in another SVD.
  # Those variants have the same meaning, so it makes sense to combine these differences.
  #
  # This behavior isn't always appropriate. For example, an IOMUXC field LPSPI1_SCK_SELECT_INPUT
  # on the 1021 might have enum variants named GPIO_SD_B0_02_ALT4 and GPIO_AD_B0_10_ALT1.
  # The same field on the 1011 might have enum variants named GPIO_AD_06_ALT0 and
  # GPIO_SD_08_ALT2 with the same respective values. If the combiner does not check
  # the names, its allowed to replace the 1021 enum variants with the 1011 names. That's
  # confusing and misleading. So in cases where this behavior shouldn't happen, we add
  # those peripherals to this list, and we force the combiner to consider the enum variant
  # names.
  #
  # It's always safe to add to this list. By adding peripherals to this list, you make it harder
  # to develop drivers that work across all MCUs.

  # IR paths that should never be combined.
  #
  # These regexes match IR paths. If there's a match, that element is *never* considered for
  # combination by the combiner. When applied to blocks, this is a stronger "never combine"
  # guarantee than StrictEnumNames. In particular, if an IOMUXC block were in this list, this
  # would prevent the 1061 IOMUXC from being combined with the 1062 IOMUXC.
