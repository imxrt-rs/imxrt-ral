# The 0th ENDPTCTRL is always a control endpoint, which has
# fewer fields than the rest of the ENDPTCTRL registers. It
# also has a different reset value. We exclude ENDPTCTRL0
# from the array.

# svdtool doesn't seem to respect or utilize the '%s' placeholders, although there are
# are examples of this pattern in the stm32-rs [1]. Instead, we'll modify the description
# for ENDPTCTRL1 before turning it into an array, since the tool seems to be using the description
# from that register. We'll use a general 'Endpoint Control' description.
