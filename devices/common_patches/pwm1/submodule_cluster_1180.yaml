# The PWM submodules may be represented as a cluster, rather that
# individually named registers. This patch uses the default submodule
# clustering directives, removes one of the fault disable mapping
# registers, and add some extra filter registers at the end.

  _delete:
    # This IP block does not have SM0PHASEDLY. Without this, clustering
    # succeeds, but it doesn't account for the fact that *most* clusters
    # have a phase delay. We'll remove the other phase delay registers
    # until someone needs them.
