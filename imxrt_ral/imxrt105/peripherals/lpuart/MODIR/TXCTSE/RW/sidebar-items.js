The transmitter checks the state of CTS each time it is ready to send a character. If CTS is asserted, the character is sent. If CTS is deasserted, the signal TXD remains in the mark state and transmission is delayed until CTS is asserted. Changes in CTS as a character is being sent do not affect its transmission."]]};
