Stop the executing channel and force the minor loop to finish. The cancel takes effect after the last write of the current read/write sequence. The ECX bit clears itself after the cancel is honored. In addition to cancelling the transfer, ECX treats the cancel as an error condition, thus updating the Error Status register (DMAx_ES) and generating an optional error interrupt."]]};
